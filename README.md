# **"What are you doing currently? What are you learning?"**
I'm learning and playing around with a few languages, see pinned repositories for an idea of what I'm upto. 

The languages currently are: 
- Python
- Java
- Go

Maybe I'll play with a bit of Rust

I wanna write software to entertain myself and help people. \
Tho I don't think I achived the latter goal till now.

> Fun stuff aside, I have to give entrance examination for college, kinda scared how i am gonna do that.
